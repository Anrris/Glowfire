This repository is the implementation of the following arXiv article:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08470

Where I introduced a novel clustering algorithm that depends only on a single parameter to describe the approximate separation distance between clusters.

Academic research of using this algorithm including the source code must reference this arXiv article.
